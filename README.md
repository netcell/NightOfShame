## The Game

An action Sound-based game that call to stop satanic ritual abuse. The game features the immersive experience of a girl under assaults to show how terrifying it could be.

## Inspiration

Based on the Cologne New Year gang assault incident where there is about 1000 men roaming the street robbing and sexual harassing the women. At least 2 rape were recorded and multiple reports within the night and even the polices don’t know how to react. Research show that incident could be originally because of some religious belief: the men have the right over the women. Further learning suggest us there may some relation between the belief and the satanic ritual abuse. So we take a step forward to implement the idea into a game: a ritual where men try sexual assaults on women in the name of purification.

## What it does

The purpose of the game is to show that regardless of the intention, that kind of action must be stopped. Rating: 16+. Genre: Action, Mature.
